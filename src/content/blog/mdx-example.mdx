# MDX Example

This post is written in **MDX**, which means it can embed React components alongside Markdown.

## Standard Markdown

Regular Markdown features work as expected:

1. Ordered lists
2. Code blocks
3. Links and emphasis

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello from MDX!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Inline JSX

MDX supports inline JSX expressions:

<div style={{ padding: "1rem", background: "#f0f0f0", borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}>
  This div is rendered from JSX inside the MDX file.
</div>
